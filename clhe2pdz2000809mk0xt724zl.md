So What's a Design System?

A design system is a set of guidelines, rules, and assets that define how a brand or organization should be represented visually across all touchpoints. It includes elements such as the brand mission, value propositions, voice and tone, logo usage, iconography, brand colors, fonts and typography, signage specs, media formatting, and photography and graphic styles. A well-designed system ensures that the brand is represented consistently and effectively, and that all branding decisions align with the brand's mission and values.

I've listed the most important elements of a Design System (in the most accurate order). I have referred to many websites, blogs & articles on Design Systems to curate the most valuable & informative resource (ChatGPT for help)
